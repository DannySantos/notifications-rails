## Philosophy

NotificationsRails has been built with modularity in mind. It currently consists of four components each of which bringing one essential functionality to the notification-integration in your Rails app.

**[NotificationHandler](notification-handler):** Create and modify your notifications through a simple API.

**[NotificationRenderer](notification-renderer):** Render your notifications on multiple platforms by specifying notification types.

**[NotificationPusher](notification-pusher):** Push your notifications to various services. Including [Email](notification-pusher-actionmailer), [ActionCable](notification-pusher-actioncable), [OneSignal (cross-platform notifications)](notification-pusher-onesignal).

**[NotificationSettings](notification-settings):** Integrates with your authentication solution to craft a personalized user notification platform.

You may just add the components you actually need, or instead use this gem to bundle everything for a complete notification solution.
