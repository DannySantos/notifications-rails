## Usage

### Pushers

A pusher handles the process of sending your notifications to various services for you.

#### Defining a pusher

You define pushers in your `NotificationPusher` configuration (`config/initializers/notification-pusher.rb`). Using:

```ruby
NotificationPusher.configure do |config|
    config.define_pusher name, options
end
```

More details about defining a specific pusher (name and available options) are available in the respective documentation of the gem.

#### Using a pusher

It is super simple to initialize a push:

```ruby
notification = Notification.create target: User.first, object: Recipe.first
notification.push name, custom_options
```

Where `name` is the name of the defined pusher and `custom_options` are the options that will override the default options the pusher has been defined with.

You are also able to do the exact same in just one line of code:

```ruby
notification = Notification.create target: User.first, object: Recipe.first, pusher: name, pusher_options: custom_options
```

**Note:** In this case, pass `custom_options` as a `Hash`.

It is possible to use mutliple pushers at a time:

```ruby
notification.push [name_one, name_two], name_one: custom_options, name_two: custom_options
```

### Writing a custom pusher

Writing custom pushers is fairly simple. Just add a new subclass to `NotificationPusher`:

```ruby
class NotificationPusher::CustomPusher

    def initialize notification, options = {}
        # ...
    end

end
```

This is how to define and use your pusher:

```ruby
NotificationPusher.configure do |config|
    config.define_pusher :CustomPusher, option_one: 'value_one'
end
```

```ruby
notification = Notification.create target: User.first, object: Recipe.first
notification.push :CustomPusher, option_one: 'value_two'
```

For further reference take a look at the default [ActionMailer](notification-pusher-actionmailer), [ActionCable](notification-pusher-actioncable) and [OneSignal](notification-pusher-onesignal) pusher.
