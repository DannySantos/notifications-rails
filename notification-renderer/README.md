## Installation

NotificationRenderer works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'notification-renderer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install notification-renderer

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'notification-renderer', github: 'jonhue/notifications-rails/tree/master/notification-renderer'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g notification_renderer:install

To wrap things up, migrate the changes to your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

### Types

NotificationRenderer uses templates to render your notifications.

The `type` of a notification determines which template gets utilized for rendering. Each notification type has multiple templates each of which responsible for rendering a notification in another scenario. The default template for a given type is `index`.

#### Generating a new type

This gem comes with a generator to make adding new types a whole lot easier. Run in your terminal:

    $ rails g notification_renderer:type -t notification

This will create the following structure in your application:

* `views`
    * `notifications`
        * `notification`
            * `_index.html.erb`

You can also customize the generated templates (renderers):

    $ rails g notification_renderer:type -t notification -r index feed

This command will also create a custom renderer called `feed` for the notification type `notification`:

* `views`
    * `notifications`
        * `notification`
            * `_feed.html.erb`
            * `_index.html.erb`

#### Using a type

You are able to specify the `type` of a `Notification` record:

```ruby
notification = Notification.create target: User.first, object: Recipe.first, type: 'notification'
```

**Note:** The `type` attribute of any new `Notification` record will default to the [`default_type` configuration](#configuration).

### Renderers

In your renderers you can access the `Notification` record through the `notification` variable. This is how a renderer could look like:

```erb
<%= notification.target.name %> commented on <%= notification.object.article.title %>.
```

### View helpers

NotificationRenderer introduces some view helpers to assist you in embedding notifications.

#### `render_notification`

`render_notification` renders a single `Notification` record:

```erb
<%= render_notification Notification.first %>
```

Rendering a notification will set its `read` attribute to `true`.

You can also specify a renderer. It defaults to `'index'`.

```erb
<%= render_notification Notification.first, 'feed' %>
```

#### `render_notifications`

`render_notifications` takes an ActiveRecord array of `Notification` records and renders each of them in order:

```erb
<%= render_notifications Notification.all %>
```

You can also specify a renderer. It defaults to `'index'`.

```erb
<%= render_notifications Notification.all, 'feed' %>
```

It wraps the rendered notifications in a `div`:

```html
<div class="notification-renderer notifications">
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Grouping

You can group any ActiveRecord array of `Notification` records by an attribute value:

```ruby
Notification.grouping('object.article')
Notification.grouping('metadata[:title]')
```

When rendering notifications you often want to group them by the object they belong to. This is how to group notifications by the associated object:

```erb
<%= render_notifications_grouped Notification.all, 'object', 'feed' %>
```

You can also group notifications by nested attributes:

```erb
<%= render_notifications_grouped Notification.all, 'object.article' %>
<%= render_notifications_grouped Notification.all, 'metadata[:title]' %>
```

It is also possible to group notifications for just one object:

```erb
<%= render_notifications_grouped Notification.where(object_id: 1, object_type: 'Comment'), 'object' %>
```

This will render the last notification for every group and pass the attributes value grouped by to your renderer:

```erb
<!-- View -->

<%= render_notifications_grouped Notification.all, 'object.article' %>


<!-- Renderer -->

<% if notification_grouped? %>
    <%= notification.target.name %> and <%= (notification_count - 1).to_s %> others commented on <%= attribute.title %>.
<% else %>
    <%= notification.target.name %> commented on <%= notification.object.article.title %>.
<% end %>
```

Grouping makes the following two methods available in your renderer:

**`attribute`** The value of the attribute used for grouping.

**`notification_count`** The notification count for the group of the current notification.

You may check whether a template is being used for grouping by using the `notification_grouped?` helper method.

---

## Configuration

You can configure NotificationRenderer by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/notification-renderer.rb`:

```ruby
NotificationRenderer.configure do |config|
    config.default_type = 'notification'
end
```

**`default_type`** Choose your default notification type. Takes a string. Defaults to `'notification'`.

**`default_renderer`** Choose your default renderer. Takes a string. Defaults to `'index'`.
