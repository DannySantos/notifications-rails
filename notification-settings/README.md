## Installation

NotificationSettings works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install notification-settings

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'notification-settings', github: 'jonhue/notifications-rails/tree/master/notification-settings'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g notification_settings:install

To wrap things up, migrate the changes to your database:

## Usage

To add settings to a notification target add `notification_settings` to the class:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    notification_target
    notification_settings
end
```

This will create a `NotificationSettings::Setting` record for every newly created object. It is accessible by calling:

```ruby
User.first.notification_setting
```

### Categories

...

### Subscriptions

...

### Status

NotificationSettings comes with a handy feature called Status. The status of a record can temporarily disable the ability to create notifications for or to push notifications of a target.

This is how to define a status:

```ruby
User.first.notification_setting.status = 'do not disturb'
User.first.notification_setting.save
```

**Note:** You can set `status` to any string you like.

`status` has three possible values that are being used as defaults. Normally it defaults to `'online'`. If the `last_seen` [configuration](#configuration) option has been set, it can also default to `'idle'` or `'offline'` depending on the `idle_after` and `offline_after` [configuration](#configuration) options.

If you have set `status` to a custom value, you can get back to using the defaults by setting it back to `nil`.

You can define statuses that prevent creating new notifications for a target and statuses that just prevent pushing them:

```ruby
NotificationSettings.configure do |config|
    config.do_not_notify_statuses = ['do not notify']
    config.do_not_push_statuses = ['do not disturb']
end
```

## Configuration

You can configure NotificationSettings by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/notification-settings.rb`:

```ruby
NotificationSettings.configure do |config|
    config.idle_after = 10.minutes
end
```

### Status

**`idle_after`** Time duration without activity after which the status defaults to `'idle'`. Takes a time. Defaults to `10.minutes`.

**`offline_after`** Time duration without activity after which the status defaults to `'offline'`. Takes a time. Defaults to `3.hours`.

**`last_seen`** Stringified datetime attribute name of `object` that defines the time of the last activity. Takes a string. Defaults to `'last_seen'`.

**`do_not_notify_statuses`** Array of possible statuses that will prevent creating notifications for a target. Takes an array of strings. Defaults to `[]`.

**`do_not_push_statuses`** Array of possible statuses that will prevent pushing notifications of a target. Takes an array of strings. Defaults to `['do not disturb']`.
